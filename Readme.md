# Console Twitter

This codebase implements a simplified version of Twitter using commands passed from console. The implementation is naive, allowing for various refactoring exercises and design conversations.


## Inspiration

The codebase was inspired by the [Twitter Kata by Sandro Mancuso](https://github.com/sandromancuso/twitter-kata-java), but it is implemented with a different goal.
